# Image Processing with MATLAB

This repository demonstrates a step-by-step image processing workflow using MATLAB. The steps include converting an image to grayscale, binarizing the image, applying various filters, and finally applying a Gaussian filter.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply different image processing techniques on a sample image ('flower.jpg') using MATLAB. The techniques include grayscale conversion, binary imaging, thresholding with Otsu's method, and applying various filters such as Mean, Gaussian, Prewitt, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). Custom row-wise and column-wise mean and median filters are also implemented.
